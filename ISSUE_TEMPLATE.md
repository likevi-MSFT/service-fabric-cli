When reporting a new issue include the following information:

- [ ] `sfctl` version, can check this using `pip show sfctl`
- [ ] Service Fabric cluster runtime version
- [ ] Service Fabric hosting location (on-premise or Azure usually)
- [ ] Debug log if an error is present (can be captured using `--debug` flag)

Be sure to check if an issue already exists with your symptoms. If so, leave a `:thumbsup:` reaction to the original issue, rather than creating a duplicate.
